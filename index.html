My name is</h5> <h2>Federico Casula</h2> <h1>I am a Web Developer</h1> <p>I have recently entered the IT industry and after finishing my studies in business and administration, I completed a Data Science course and am currently studying web development at the DCi school in Berlin.</p> </section>   <a id="about"></a> <section class="about"> <div> <h1>About me</h1> <p> Hi! My name is Federico Casula and I am passionate about web development. I've always been fascinated by computers since I was a child and recently decided to study as a developer. I'm Italian but I currently live in Berlin where I study at the DCi. </p> <p> Since I started my journey at dci (October 2022) until today, I have managed to cover the core digital literacy portions and have finished the UI Fundamentals portion. Below in my portfolio, you will find some examples of projects I have completed. </p> </div> <img src="Federico_Casula.91e25e4e.jpeg" alt="Federico Casula"> </section>   <a id="works"></a> <section class="cards"> <a class="project_1" href="#"> <article class="article-1"> <h1>Some of my projects</h1> <h2>Advanced Animations</h2> <p>This project was recently created in collaboration with a teacher and focuses on the use of advanced animations, in this case, as we can see in the photos on the side, a very simple html file was built and subsequently they were applied (on the css file) of the keyframes combined with a simple animation that makes the letters appear, in this case of my name, in steps with a delay of 1 second each.</p> <p>If you want to see the files in detail, I uploaded everything to my GitHub and you can view it by clicking on this button:</p> <input type="button" onclick="window.location.href='https://federicocsl.github.io/Advanced_Animations_1/';" value="Click here to see the animation "> </article> <div class="pic_project_1"> <img src="Advanced_animations1.d33707db.png" alt="code with focus in keyframes"> <video width="320" height="240" controls> <source src="Advanced_Animations_video.202510e0.webm" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div> </a> <a class="project_2" href="#"> <article class="article-2"> <h2>Speaker Shop</h2> <p>Speaker Shop is the perfect example of the simplicity of a shopping site, easy to create and has the products for sale as its focus on the cards. Fully functional including video button. As in the previous project, on the side you can see a general overview of the css document with focus on the header and below the photo of the website.</p> <p>If you want to see the files in detail, I uploaded everything to my GitHub and you can view it by clicking on this button:</p> <input type="button" onclick="window.location.href='https://federicocsl.github.io/speaker-shop/;" value="Click here to see the shop "> </article> <div class="pic_project_2"> <img src="speaker-shop-code.331de1fb.png" alt="Speaker shop code"> <img src="speaker-shop.7605050d.png" alt="speaker shop preview"> </div> </a> <a class="project_3" href="#"> <article class="article-3"> <h2>Flyer Website using grid</h2> <p>The grid layout system makes the website more organized and as in this case, where we have different colored boxes and background images, it makes the site more dynamic and pleasant to view. In the upper part there is also a functional navigation bar with the possibility of being able to apply a company logo. The css screenshot has a focus on the part built with the grid that divides the container into rows and columns with different backgrounds.</p> <input type="button" onclick="window.location.href='https://federicocsl.github.io/grid_project/" value="Click here to see the website "> </article> <div class="pic_project_3"> <img src="Grid-code.824f8dc1.png" alt="grid code"> <img src="Grid_project.b266a422.png" alt="grid project preview"> </div> </a> </section>   <a id="contact"></a> <section class="contact"> <div class="container"> <form action="action_page"> <h2>Contact me for more information</h2> <label for="fname">First Name</label> <input type="text" id="fname" name="firstname" placeholder="Your name.."> <label for="lname">Last Name</label> <input type="text" id="lname" name="lastname" placeholder="Your last name.."> <label for="name">Company</label> <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Company name.."> <label for="country">Country</label> <select id="country" name="country"> <option value="australia">Australia</option> <option value="canada">Canada</option> <option value="usa">USA</option> </select> <label for="subject">Subject</label> <textarea id="subject" name="subject" placeholder="Write something.." style="height:100px"></textarea> <form action="mailto:you@yourwebsite.com"></form><input type="submit" value="Submit"> </form> </div> <div class="find_me"> <h3>Or find me on..</h3> <a href="https://github.com/FedericoCsl"><i class="fa-3x fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-casula/"><i class="fa-3x fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div> </section> </main>    <footer> <h3>Thank you for visiting my website!</h3> <p>Website created by Federico Casula</p> </footer>  </body></html>
